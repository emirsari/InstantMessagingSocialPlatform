<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>  
&emsp; The Instant Messaging Social Platform project was developed as part of a database management system course. The project's main goal was to design and implement a database for an instant messaging social platform, similar to popular platforms like Discord or Slack. This platform allows users to interact within various servers and chat rooms, offering features such as user roles, bots, server boosts, and messaging functionalities.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>User-Server-Bot Relationship:</b> The database structure revolves around users, servers, and bots. Users can join multiple servers, each with chat rooms where they can send messages. Bots provide additional functionality, and users can purchase boosts to enhance server capabilities. </li>
  <li><b>Role Management:</b> Users are assigned specific roles within servers, allowing them to manage server members. Roles define permissions such as inviting, removing, or banning users. </li>
  <li><b>Server Boosts:</b> Users can boost servers to unlock additional features, such as increased upload size limits and more emoji slots. </li>
  <li><b>Bot Integration:</b> Bots can be integrated into servers, providing unique functionalities like music playback or chat moderation. </li>
  <li><b>Payment System:</b> The platform supports a payment system where users can purchase server boosts and bots using stored credit card information. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Technical Details</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Database Design:</b> The project involved designing an Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagram and a schema diagram to map out the database structure. The database was created using Oracle SQL Developer. </li>
  <li><b>SQL Implementation:</b> The database was implemented with SQL, including CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, INSERT INTO, and various SELECT queries to manage and retrieve data. </li>
  <li><b>Query Operations:</b> The project includes complex SQL queries, such as joins, nested queries, set operations, and aggregate functions. These queries manage user roles, server memberships, and financial transactions. </li>
  <li><b>Relational Algebra & Calculus:</b> The project also demonstrates the use of relational algebra and calculus for querying the database, showcasing the depth of understanding in database theory. </li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Database Management:</b> Oracle SQL Developer </li>
  <li><b>Programming Languages:</b> SQL </li>
  <li><b>Database Theory:</b> Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus </li>
</ul>
